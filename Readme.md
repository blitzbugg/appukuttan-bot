Appukuttan’s chilling on GCP, but if you dare to run him locally, here’s the guide (without breaking a leg):

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/) (1.21+—Appukuttan demands the latest, but he’ll break it anyway!)
- Discord bot token (from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)—hide it from Appukuttan!)
- Spotify API creds (from [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/)—don’t let him spill them!).

### Local Setup (For the Brave!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blitzbugg/appukuttan-bot.git
cd appukuttan-bot
```

2. Grab the tools:

```bash
go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo
go get github.com/zmb3/spotify/v2

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
